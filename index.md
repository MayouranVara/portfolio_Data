### IA Projects 

[Prediction of Wine Quality](Prediction_of_Wine_quality.html)<br />
I conducted a Machine Learning project focused on predicting wine quality based on composition analysis. The analysis encompassed statistical exploration, including data types, missing values, and correlations. For prediction, I applied both regression, using Linear Regression and model comparisons, and classification, employing methods like K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Bayes Classifier. The results underwent visual representation, emphasizing scatter plots and decision trees. The theoretical aspect involved providing algorithmic formalism, detailing parameters, and concluding with method comparisons. The report not only discussed the motivations behind the chosen methods but also analyzed results and proposed potential enhancements, such as combining methods for improved wine quality prediction.

[Clustering Of Mobile Price on Today's Market](Clustering_of_Mobile_Price.html)<br />
I led a clustering project using market mobile prices to estimate our (fake) company's mobile prices. Employing techniques like PCA, KMeans, t-SNE, and k-Medoids, I aimed to create new cluster labels aligning with the 'price_range' target variable. The analysis involved dimensionality reduction with PCA, clustering with KMeans and k-Medoids, and visualization using t-SNE. The report highlights the efficacy of these methods in creating meaningful price clusters, providing insights for our pricing strategy.
