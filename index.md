### IA Projects 

[Prediction of Wine Quality](Prediction_of_Wine_quality.html)<br />
I conducted a Machine Learning project focused on predicting wine quality based on composition analysis. The analysis encompassed statistical exploration, including data types, missing values, and correlations. For prediction, I applied both regression, using Linear Regression and model comparisons, and classification, employing methods like K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Bayes Classifier. The results underwent visual representation, emphasizing scatter plots and decision trees. The theoretical aspect involved providing algorithmic formalism, detailing parameters, and concluding with method comparisons. The report not only discussed the motivations behind the chosen methods but also analyzed results and proposed potential enhancements, such as combining methods for improved wine quality prediction.

[Clustering Of Mobile Price on Today's Market](Clustering_of_Mobile_Price.html)<br />
I led a clustering project using market mobile prices to estimate our (fake) company's mobile prices. Employing techniques like PCA, KMeans, t-SNE, and k-Medoids, I aimed to create new cluster labels aligning with the 'price_range' target variable. The analysis involved dimensionality reduction with PCA, clustering with KMeans and k-Medoids, and visualization using t-SNE. The report highlights the efficacy of these methods in creating meaningful price clusters, providing insights for our pricing strategy.

[Estimacloud with OnePoint](ESTIMACLOUD.html)<br />
Role : Product Owner and Python Developper<br />
I spearheaded a pricing tool project estimating cloud infrastructure costs using Flutter for the web interface. Elasticsearch and Logstash were employed to retrieve real-time cloud service prices, while Flask and the Random Forest machine learning algorithm were utilized for invoice preparation. This comprehensive approach integrates user-friendly design, dynamic pricing data extraction, and machine learning for accurate billing, providing an efficient solution for estimating cloud infrastructure expenses. ( No code because this tool is now used by OnePoint)

### Category Name 2

[Japan Netflix Preferences](Japanese_Netflix_presentation.html)<br />
In my Tableau-based visualization project on a Netflix database, I addressed four pivotal questions. I utilized visual insights to recommend the optimal streaming platform by analyzing genre popularity, user ratings, and viewer demographics. The decision between a movie or TV show adaptation was informed by visualizing data on runtime, genre trends, and audience engagement. To identify the best TV show or movie type for adaptation, I employed data visualizations highlighting genre preferences, viewer ratings, and popular themes. Lastly, I recommended an appropriate director based on visual analytics, considering factors such as viewer ratings, awards, and genre expertise. This comprehensive approach provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making in content adaptation.
